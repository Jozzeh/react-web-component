# React & Web components

Example of an integration of vanilla web components in React with bi-directional communication...  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Rating Webcomponent with bidirectional communication  

This project shows a very small example on how the state of a web component can be given to React and the other way around (from React to a web component).  

[use-custom-element](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-custom-element) module is used in this example and really makes it a lot easier.
